### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python (Data Preprocessing)
Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib:
- Cleaned raw dataset (handled missing values, renamed columns)
- Engineered new features:
  - Total_Goals = HomeGoals + AwayGoals
  - Result = Home Win / Away Win / Draw
  - Possession_Group = <40%, 40‚Äì60%, >60%
- Exported cleaned dataset as football_clean.csv

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL (Data Analysis)
Wrote SQL queries to validate and analyze:
```sql
-- Average goals per match
SELECT AVG(HomeGoals + AwayGoals) AS avg_goals
FROM football_matches;

-- Matches by result
SELECT Result, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM football_matches
GROUP BY Result;

-- Average goals by league
SELECT League, AVG(HomeGoals + AwayGoals) AS avg_goals
FROM football_matches
GROUP BY League;

-- Home win % by possession group
SELECT Possession_Group,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Result='Home Win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*),2) AS home_win_pct
FROM football_matches
GROUP BY Possession_Group;
